##Penguin's Crowdfunding Idea: 
+ Purpose: Raise money for Nepal's earthquake relief organizations (specific organization tbd)  -Dev
+ Target Audience: Gamers, especially friends of the person(s) that volunteer to participate. 
+ Idea: Host a gaming marathon, similar to  https://pledgeit.org/jessejames and https://desertbus.org/  -**John**/Tom/Andree
  + People to pledge a dollar amount for every time a player saves the princess in Super Mario Brothers on the original NES in a certain time frame - but here’s the catch - it’s someone who is terrible at video games and has never saved the princes despite playing Mario Brothers for a long time.  It might be fun to watch someone go from being terrible at it to being boringly good in a day.  Technically, it can be beaten in as little as ~5mins. Maybe after a certain number of wins, the player has to play at some disadvantage, like one-handed.  Or maybe get bonus points for beating it blindfolded. I’ve seen someone beat the first two levels blindfolded. -**JOHN**

###What needs to be done ahead of time?  
+ Pick a specific organization to donate to, get photos/materials to help promote the cause. 
+ Get players to participate, shoot preview gameplay footage and interviews to use in promotional video. (This also means we need to make sure we have good microphones, video, and editing equipment). -Sophia
+ Come up with more challenge ideas, and set up channel for donors who contribute enough to suggest additional challenges. 
+ (possible idea: come up with logo for bumper sticker/decal design, and order some get made.) -Sophia

###Prices
*Pledges start with a minimum donation, but donors can opt to pledge more for greater rewards*
+ Minimum $3 pledge per time the player saves the princess
+ Minimum $5 pledge per hour of gaming that the player lasts before quitting.
+ Minimum $20 Donation: Create your own challenge for the player, pay per time the player accomplishes the goal. 

###Deliverable:
+ Everyone that donates gets an email invitation to watch the game streaming live online, and their name in the thank you credits. -Ruth
+ Those that pledge at least the minimum amount will get a personalized card or email that features a screenshot of the game. 
+ Those that pledge three dollars or more above get the card/email plus a bumper sticker/decal.
+ Those that pledge ten dollars or more over the minimum get their name and message mentioned/read by the player(s) during the game.
